 Potion of animal intelligence

Dearest Readers, 
    Have you been having trouble with a tiresome mare? Once your whelp has had a lick of this, they'll be walking on two legs and taking your inventory!
	I first began developing this recipe with some of my friends from the knitting club. If you're reading this now, surely you've heard what a wild cast of characters we have over there. So one of my dear friends there (who shall remain anonymous so as to protects one delicate family structure, what with her husband making leery eyes at that no good harlot next door, and with her two sons working not an ounce for what their dear old mom does for them) had some trouble with one of her three cats getting where it wasn't meant to. We did some digging and found an old recipe by some fuddy duddy, and updated it a bit to our liking.
	Updating a potion is no small task, mind you. Your dear ol' gran had to toil and trifle, such that the potion crafted best aligns with positive traits in animals. Back in my youth on the farm it was in fashion to have large and wild beasts, but now it's in vogue for animals to be tame, docile servants. After some trying, using begonea instead of silver silin had the desired effect.
	Lets go through some of the features. This potion should increase the beast's memory, alertness, and intelligence.
	We all know what it's like to have a pet that just won't quit! No matter how many times you tell your pet not to bark at the nice man next door who is just coming by for some spices in the middle of the night when your husband is out hunting, he still barks! This should help the pup learn a lesson and learn it well.
	If you're a longtime reader, you'll remember when I was Ms. Twistyspice, then Mrs. Lightroot, then Mrs. Sugarweather, then Mrs. Elmbug, and finally Granny Elmbug. This is all to say, I'm no spring chicken! And I need to keep abreast of all that goes on in my fair hamlet. The best way to do this nowadays is to have a pup that keeps a watchful eye. This potion will help with such matters.
	While Intelligence is hard to put plain, it is somewhat simplified by the creatures we're dealing with. While a dog will never reach human level intelligence, it might be able to, say, grab a stick suitable to whip my grandkids into shape. Again.
	
Alright ladies, let's get potting!
	As always, start your potion in a neutral bath.
		One Dobberchu
		One Mandrake
		One Begonea
	Add them such that the final result is nearest the color of your cauldron.

Best wishes,
	Granny Elmbug
